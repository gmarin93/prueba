Fetching Data:
    Axios was used to fetch the data from the API because of their wide options, one of them is that
turns the response in JSON in a easier way than fetch() .

Showing Data:
     One of the a lots solutions to show the data from the API, was in Cards, making the comments be matched with its right
    post all of it in one place .
    Then, it is possible hide and show the comments, once you have clicked to see the commments
    you are able to add new comments at the end of the list or hide all comments.
    Bootstrap was used to add some styles to the app.

Relate comments to posts:
     To manage the new Comments information, everything was manage by principal state, using Redux.
    Once the data is gotten from the API, it passed through a function that matched all data well and then it will be possible
    to see the cards with the comments and posts.
